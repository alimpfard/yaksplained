The name is not yakkies, as would be expected from adopting the Twitch meme, instead the name yakkie reflects the other, much older server emote :poggie: ![poggie](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/838468228279828500.png), another poggies emote that is one of the most popular emotes on the server in general.","description":"A yak version of the POGGIES emote popular on Twitch. Used to show excitement.","image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/933441581258768394.png","remark":"POGGIES","name":"Yakkie"}
